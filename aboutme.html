<p class="about-text">I am a Doctor of Economics from University of Brasília (UnB, 2012). I also have a bachelor's degree in Economics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS, 2007) and a master's degree in Economics from University of Brasília (UnB, 2010).</p>

<p class="about-text">I have worked in <a href="http://www.caixa.gov.br">Caixa Econômica Federal</a> from 2005 to 2008 in Porto Alegre (RS), mainly with credit analysis in activities such as debt acquisitions from another banks, credit qualification from FCVS (Fundo de Compensação de Variação Salarial) and credit management from FIES (Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil). I have moved to Brasília in 2008 to pursue a master's and doctorate degrees in Economics at <a href="http://www.unb.br">UnB</a>. During this time I worked mainly with financial econometrics under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jglresende/">José Guilherme de Lara Resende</a>. In 2011 I got back to Porto Alegre as a lecturer from the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/decon/">Department of Economics</a> at <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br">UFRGS</a>, teaching mostly introductory economics. In late 2012 I joined the <a href="http://www2.ufpel.edu.br/ich/economia/">Department of Economics</a> and the Graduate Program of <a href="http://www2.ufpel.edu.br/ppgom/site/">PPGOM</a>, both at Federal University of Pelotas (<a href="http://www.ufpel.edu.br">UFPel</a>). In 2014 I also spent some time at <a href="http://eesp.fgv.br/">EESP/FGV</a> as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>

<p class="about-text">Currently, I am a professor and head of the Department of Economics at the Federal University of Pelotas, where I teach basic statistics and finance for undergraduates, and time series and recursive macroeconomics for graduates. My research expertise includes topics such as applied finance, banking, economic growth, labor and agriculture economics, but I am also interested in everything that has to do with data analysis. I have published articles in journals such as Economics Bulletin, Latin American Business Review, Brazilian Review of Finance, Revista Brasileira de Economia, Economia Aplicada, Brazilian Journal of Business Economics and others. I have also revised articles for journals such as Journal of Banking and Finance, Environment, Development and Sustainability, Brazilian Review of Finance, Economic Analysis of Law Review, EconomiA and others.
