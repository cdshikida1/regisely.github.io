<div id="aboutme-section">

<p class="about-text">I am a Doctor of Economics from University of Brasília (UnB) since September 2012. I also have a bachelor's degree in Economics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS, 2007) and a master's degree in Economics from University of Brasília (UnB, 2010).</p>

<p class="about-text">I am currently 31 years. I have worked in <a href="http://www.caixa.gov.br">Caixa Econômica Federal</a> from 2005 and 2008 in Porto Alegre (RS), mainly with credit analysis such as debt acquisitions from another banks, credit qualification from FCVS (Fundo de Compensação de Variação Salarial) and credit management from FIES (Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil). I have moved to Brasília in 2008 to pursue a master's degree in Economics at <a href="http://www.unb.br">UnB</a> and end up with a doctoral degree. During this time I worked mainly with financial econometrics under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jglresende/">José Guilherme de Lara Resende</a>. In 2011 I got back to Porto Alegre as a lecturer from the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/decon/">Department of Economics</a> at <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br">UFRGS</a>, teaching mostly introductory economics. In late 2012 I got to know the magically 100% mainstream <a href="http://www2.ufpel.edu.br/ich/economia/">Department of Economics</a> (yes, we need a new site) at Federal University of Pelotas (<a href="http://www.ufpel.edu.br">UFPel</a>). We are a happy team of 10 professors running an undergraduate course in Economics and a master's program in Applied Economics. Apart from the teaching and the research, all of the administrative duties are left to us. Believe me, a lot of experience comes from that (the good and the bad ones). In 2014 I also spent some time at <a href="http://eesp.fgv.br/">EESP/FGV</a> as a postdoctoral researcher...</p>

<p class="about-text">In my current job I am teaching basic statistics, linear algebra and finance for undergraduates and time series and recursive macroeconomics for postgraduates. My research expertise is mainly in applied finance, banking and recursive macroeconomics, but I am interested in everything that has to do with data analysis. Papers, reviews, advisoring, administrative tasks (comite das bolsas, comite dos CIC/ENPOS, coordenador adjunto) Softwares and scritps... </p>
