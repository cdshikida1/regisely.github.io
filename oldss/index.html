  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>This site is under construction. Go to <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/regisaely">this one</a>.</p>

  <p>I am a Professor in the <a href="http://www2.ufpel.edu.br/ich/economia/"><i>Department of Economics</i></a> at <a href="http://portal.ufpel.edu.br/"><i>Federal University of Pelotas</i></a>. I work with applied econometrics, more precisely with time series analysis, finance and recursive macroeconomics. Here you will find a lot of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching">course materials</a> (mostly in portuguese), <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> scripts, <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> templates, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> configuration files and other interesting things.</p>

  <p><b>If you are a student</b>, you probably want to take a look at my <a href="/teaching">teaching</a> materials and the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a>. If you really need to talk to me (i.e there is something not answered in the FAQ), then you can send me an <a href="mailto:regisaely@gmail.com">email</a>, but I might not answer right away, so the best way to meet me would be to make me a visit at Tuesdays from 4 to 6 pm at Room L in the Department of Economics of UFPel (Campus Porto - 4ยบ floor).</p>

  <p><b>If you are a good student</b>, you probably want to take a look at my my <a href="/softwares">softwares</a> section and my <a href="/resources">resources</a> section too, and maybe read my posts below. If you are not there yet, but want to be a good student, then you should read my <a href="/studenttips">student tips</a>.</p>

  <p><b>If you are a researcher or professor</b>, you might want to take a look at my posts, my <a href="/softwares">softwares</a> section, or my <a href="https://github.com/regisely">github repository</a>. If you think it would be great to work with me in some project, please <a href="mailto:regisaely@gmail.com">email</a> me.</p>

  <p><b>If you are a professional</b> looking for some consulting or lecture, take a look at my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> and my <a href="/cv">short CV</a>. If you want me to quit my job and accept your job offer, there is a good chance i'll do it if it is <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21664084-mystery-why-it-didnt-happen-sooner-brazil-junked">outside of Brazil</a> and Latin America. I am currently searching for postdoctoral fellowships also (specially in Australia and the USA).</p>
